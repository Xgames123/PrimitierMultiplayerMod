## If you want to help
* I never worked in a team before so If you have suggestions for how to do things on github you can ask me
* You can join and leave whenever you want
* If you just want to work on a specific part of the mod you can (Like if you only want to do networking stuff and not modding stuff)
* If you have suggestions for code styles feel free to suggest them
[This is the github project](https://github.com/users/Xgames123/projects/1) it has all the stuff that is planned and worked on
